## How to create a release

1. Go to GitHub releases
2. Create a new release
3. Create new tag with version #
4. Wait for CI to finish

## Building from source

To build dll and Launcher:
- `./build.sh` - Requires DirectX June 2010, MSBuild, Visual Studio 2019 and Git Bash.

To build the installer:
- `VERSION=X.X.X ./package.sh` - Expects a version to be provided by setting an environment variable. Saves and builds artifacts to `build/`. Requires Inno Setup and Git Bash.

## Troubleshooting

- `%localappdata%\Temp` - Installer logs are saved in here. E.g., `Setup Log 2023-07-13 #010.txt`
  and `mirrors-edge-multiplayer-installer-helper-*.log`
- `Get-MpThreatDetection` - Run this command in Windows PowerShell to get Windows Defender threat history to see if any of the multiplayer files were affected.
